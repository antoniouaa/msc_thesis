We employ LSTM models to fit and forecast daily closing prices for stocks and provide a comparison between the NN/LSTM method of modelling time-series and the more traditional method of using empirical observations on the structure of the data to construct and fit an ARIMA model. We collect daily stock data (open, high, low, close) from FTSE and NASDAQ companies over a range of 3 years and collect 1-day closing price forecasts from the two models for evaluation. Evaluation is performed on both models with their MSE and MAE values averaged and compared for a higher level overview of the two models. Results indicate that the LSTM model yields lower error values than the ARIMA model.
