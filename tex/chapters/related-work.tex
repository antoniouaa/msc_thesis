This section will introduce work related to stock market prediction, namely traditional asset pricing models and work related to the development of generative adversarial networks.
\section{Stock Market Prediction models}
ARIMA(1,1,1)
data mining can predict stock prices \cite{stockprediction_datamining}

\section{Generative Adversarial Networks}
This is a gan\cite{gan_original}


\section{Testing some math}
Here are two equations:

\begin{align}
a &= b + 1 \\
\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\Psi + V(\mathbf{r})\Psi
&= -i\hbar \frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t}    
\end{align}


And here is some text with some nice inline math, $(x, y)$ wow $\gamma$ so cool $\rho$.


\section{Testing citations}
This is Fama\cite{fama_efficient_market} and this is Goodfellow\cite{gan_original}.
This is another GAN citation\cite{high-frequencyGAN}.
