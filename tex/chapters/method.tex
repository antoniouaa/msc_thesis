The following section provides details in the construction of the model for predicting stock prices, as well as a breakdown of the data used in the training of the network.

\section{Dataset}
We retrieve data on tickers available at \url{https://www.tiingo.com/}. The stock exchange targeted in this project is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The data consist of daily values for NYSE listed companies for the period starting January 1, 2018 and ending December 1, 2018. The dataset includes daily information for the \texttt{close}, \texttt{open}, \texttt{high}, \texttt{low} prices and \texttt{volume} of each trading day.

The data comprise of companies from various sectors listed in the New York Stock Exchange.

Also, a table can be found in Table \ref{tbl:example-table}. You should use a \LaTeX~table generator like \url{https://www.tablesgenerator.com/} if you want to make your life easier.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \caption{Here is a table. The caption goes above like this.}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|l|c}
        First name & Last name & Age \\
        \hline\hline
        Bob & Bobbington & 24 \\
        Joe & Bloggs & 37 \\
        Billy & Bob & 10 \\

    \end{tabular}
