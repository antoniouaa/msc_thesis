Also, a table can be found in Table \ref{tbl:example-table}. You should use a \LaTeX~table generator like \url{https://www.tablesgenerator.com/} if you want to make your life easier.

\begin{table}[h]
    \caption{Here is a table. The caption goes above like this.}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|l|c}
        First name & Last name & Age \\
        \hline\hline
        Bob & Bobbington & 24 \\
        Joe & Bloggs & 37 \\
        Billy & Bob & 10 \\

    \end{tabular}
