The following section provides details in the construction of the model for predicting stock prices, as well as a breakdown of the data used in the training of the network.

\section{Dataset}
We retrieve data on tickers available at \url{https://www.tiingo.com/}. The stock exchanges targeted in this project are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) and the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE). The data comprise of companies from the technology and the financial services industries.

The data consist of daily values for the period starting January 1, 2016 and ending December 31, 2019. The dataset includes daily information for the \texttt{close}, \texttt{open}, \texttt{high} and \texttt{low} prices of each trading day.

\section{Prediction Model}

Here is a sentence, and you can see a nice picture in Figure \ref{fig:brayford}.

Also, a table can be found in Table \ref{tbl:example-table}. You should use a \LaTeX~table generator like \url{https://www.tablesgenerator.com/} if you want to make your life easier.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \caption{Here is a table. The caption goes above like this.}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|l|c}
        First name & Last name & Age \\
        \hline\hline
        Bob & Bobbington & 24 \\
        Joe & Bloggs & 37 \\
        Billy & Bob & 10 \\

    \end{tabular}
    \label{tbl:example-table}
