The ability to predict changes in stock prices is extremely important to the financial world as it influences trading strategies and reduces risks in the market. The prices of stocks can be modelled as non-linear time series, which have been at the centre of attention in the finance world since the 1970s with George Box and Gwilym Jenkins popularised their Box-Jenkins method for finding the best-fit of a time series model\cite{box_jenkins}.
